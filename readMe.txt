Steps:

1. Download chatApp Zip file
2. Once downloaded, open the terminal for both api and client folder and run "npm install". Once installed, run "yarn start" for both api and client folder
3. Once the browser has popped up, create an account
4. Log into account once created or got to URL "http://localhost:3000/login" as the address endpoint
 -Here are the users I've already created if you want to test:
email: peter@gmail.com
password: admin123

email: juana@gmail.com
password: admin321

email: jemi@gmail.com
password: admin369

5. Once logged in, change the URL address point to "http://localhost:3000/messenger". 

Notes:
 - Once the sender sends a message, the receiver URL should be refreshed first before actually getting or receiving the message.

 - I have downloaded a template for the Login and the landing page URLs but I have written the codes from scratch for the messenger/chat app (components, routers, models of both api and client folders)
